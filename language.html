    <p id="fontss">❀ Supporting Learners' Languages</p>
    <p>Translanguaging is a pedagogical approach that recognizes and values the diverse linguistic repertoires of our students. At SRVS National Higher Secondary CBSE School, we embrace translanguaging as a means of supporting learners in using their full linguistic resources for learning and communication.</p>

    <p id="fontss">❀ Integrating Translanguaging Strategies</p>
    <p>Teachers at our school are encouraged to integrate translanguaging strategies into their classroom practices. This may involve allowing students to use their mother tongue or additional languages when expressing ideas, discussing concepts, or seeking clarification. Translanguaging promotes a deeper understanding of content and ensures that language is not a barrier to learning.</p>
    
    <p id="fontss">❀ Fostering Cultural Identity</p>
    <p>Translanguaging is not only about language but also about preserving and celebrating cultural identities. We believe that by allowing students to use their languages and share their cultural perspectives, we create a more inclusive and respectful learning environment. This, in turn, promotes intercultural understanding and empathy among students.</p>
